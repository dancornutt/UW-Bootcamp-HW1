## Horiseon Web Page

The Horiseon web page meets visual needs and functionality properly but it wasn't designed with semantic tags for screenreaders and standard HTML5 syntax.

This repository has updated the **html** and **css** files for modern browsers.

#### Updates To The Page:
* Semantic HTML elements
* Proper HTML structure
* Images must have alt tags
* Heading must have sequential order
* A clear title must be present

## Project Challenges

This was the first opportunity of modifying CSS. Using the semantic tags, ids, and classes the html and css was updated. Modifying the html file would break the link with css so changes needed to be coordinated between both files before viewing changes in the browser.

This was the first time also creating a README file with styling and not just plain text. Referencing the markdown cheatsheets and online resources simplified the work. In the end the README file is a useful document and allows others to find the updated website with the embedded link.
