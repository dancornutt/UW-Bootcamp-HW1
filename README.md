## Horiseon Web Page

The Horiseon web page meets visual needs and functionly properly but it wasn't designed with semantic tags for screenreaders and standard HTML5 syntax.

This repository has updated the **html** and **css** files for modern browsers.

###Updates To The Page:
* Semantic HTML elements
* Proper HTML structure
* Images must have alt tags
* Heading must have sequential order
* A clear title must be present
